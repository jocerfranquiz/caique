# ðŸ¦œ `caique`

## A unique 8-bit concatenative stack machine based on LC-3 specs
`caique` is a bytecode stack machine and a *concatenative stack language* that uses combinator composition to build subroutines (functions). It employs a very simple syntax that supports algebraic manipulation of programs. Subroutines operate on a shared data structure.

Key aspects of **caique**:
*   *Stack-based operation* **caique** uses a stack to pass values between combinators. Values are pushed onto the stack, and operations perform computations.
*   *Compositional semantics* The syntax and semantics is inherently compositional. The reduction of any expression simplifies one function into another, without needing to apply functions.
*   *Point-free style* **caique** is **point-free**, meaning functions don't explicitly name the data they operate on.
*   *ASCII only* **caique** only operates over ASCII characters as unsigned integers (from 0 to 127).

### Definitions:
```
      quotation  -->  []

    equivalence  -->  ==

    expressions  -->  A B

      define as  -->  :=

in-line comment  -->  #
```

### Built-in combinators:

```
[B] [A] cat ==  # [B A]    concatenate
[B] [A] alt ==  # [A] [B]  alternate / swap
[A] idm ==      # [A] [A]  idem / dup
[A] qte ==      # [[A]]    quote
[A] unq ==      # A        unquote
[A] ers ==      # erase / pop
```

### Built-in operators:

```
stk  # print stack 
clr  # clean stack
add  # add two numbers and push to stack
asc  # given a number print ASCII character
```

### Defining new combinators

```
 dip  :=  alt qte cat unq   # [B] [A] dip == A [B]
cons  :=  alt qte alt cat   # [B] [A] cons == [[B] A]    
```

### Examples

```
[alt] [idm] cons ==   # result: [[alt] idm]
[alt] [idm] dip  ==   # result: idm [alt]
```
