# ðŸ¦œ `caique`

## A unique 8-bit concatenative stack machine based on LC-3 specs
`caique` is a bytecode stack machine and a *concatenative stack language* that uses combinator composition to build subroutines (functions). It employs a very simple syntax that supports algebraic manipulation of programs. Subroutines operate on a shared data structure.

Key aspects of `caique`:
*   **Stack-based operation** `caique` uses a stack to pass values between combinators. Values are pushed onto the stack, and operations perform computations.
*   **Compositional semantics** The syntax and semantics is inherently compositional. The reduction of any expression simplifies one function into another, without needing to apply functions.
*   **Point-free style** `caique` is *point-free*, meaning functions don't explicitly name the data they operate on.
*   **ASCII only** `caique` only operates over ASCII characters as unsigned integers (from 0 to 127).

### Definitions:
```
      qoutation  -->  []

    equivalence  -->  ==

    expressiona  -->  A B

      define as  -->  :=

in-line comment  -->  #
```

### Built-in combinators:

```
[B] [A] cat  # concatenate
== [B A]

[B] [A] alt  # alternate / swap
==  [A] [B]

[A] idm  # idem / dup
== [A] [A]

[A] qte  # quote
== [[A]]

[A] unq  # unquote
== A

[A] ers  # erase / pop
==
```

### Built-in operators:

```
print stack  --> stk 
clean stack  --> clr
add numbers  --> add
```

### Defining new combinators

```
 dip  :=  alt qte cat unq   # [B] [A] dip == A [B]
cons  :=  alt qte alt cat   # [B] [A] cons == [[B] A]    
```

### Examples

```
[alt] [idm] cons
== [alt] [idm] alt qte alt cat
== [idm] [alt] qte alt cat
== [idm] [[alt]] alt cat
== [[alt]] [idm] cat
== [[alt] idm]


[alt] [idm] dip
== [alt] [idm] alt qte cat call
== [idm] [alt] qte cat call
== [idm] [[alt]] cat call
== [idm [alt]] call
== idm [alt]
```
